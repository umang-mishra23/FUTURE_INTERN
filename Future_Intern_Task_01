During this task, I practically tested and understood common web vulnerabilities, including:

🔹 SQL Injection (SQLi):
I learned how improper input validation can allow attackers to manipulate database queries and access unauthorized data.

🔹 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
I understood how malicious scripts can be injected into web pages and executed in a user’s browser, affecting user data and sessions.

🔹 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):
I learned how attackers can trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions without their knowledge.

🔹 File Upload Vulnerabilities:
I explored how insecure file upload mechanisms can allow attackers to upload malicious files and compromise the server.

This hands-on practice helped me understand how real-world attacks work, why secure coding is important, and how vulnerabilities arise in web applications.

I’ve shared my complete learning and step-by-step explanation in my Medium blog.
